## Swift

Kind of looks like Ruby

coerce a type: `String(some_integer)`

#### Literals syntax

```
var listOfThings = ["thing", "another"]

dictionaries:

[
  "foo": "bar",
  "baz": "bong",
]
```

#### Similar to Ruby interpolation

"Hello \(name)"

`func` instead of `def`

return type is listed
classes

init instead of initialize

has "deinit" to clean up an instance when it is deallocated

One of the most important differences between structures and classes is that structures are always copied when they are passed around in your code, but classes are passed by reference.

Protocol is pretty much a module?
